## Introduction to Repository Pattern and Unit of Work

Repository pattern is a popular design pattern used in software development, including C# and .NET applications, especially in the context of domain-driven design and object-relational mapping (ORM). The repository pattern acts as a bridge between the business logic layer and the data access layer of an application by providing an abstraction layer over the data access layer. It allows the business logic to interact with the database without needing to know the underlying data access complexities.


## Getting Started 

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (Version .Net 6 or later)
- An IDE of your choice (e.g., [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/), [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
- Basic Understanding of ASP.NET Core Web API concepts. To have a deeper understanding of the Repository Pattern you can read my article [Repository and Unit of Work Patterns in ASP.NET Core: A Key to Cleaner C# Code and Architecture](https://medium.com/@ulomaobilookenyi/repository-pattern-in-asp-net-core-a-key-to-cleaner-c-code-and-architecture-37f76854c9fb)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ulomaramma/repository-pattern

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd repository-pattern

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   dotnet restore

## Understanding Repository Pattern and Unit of Work

## Configuring Database Connection

To integrate the Repository Pattern and Unit of Work with your data management, you'll need to configure your database connection. This can be configured in your ppsettings.json file with the following connection string:

   ```json
      "ConnectionStrings": {
        "DefaultConnection": "Server=(localdb)\\mssqllocaldb;Database=YourDatabaseName;Trusted_Connection=True;MultipleActiveResultSets=true"
      }
  ```
